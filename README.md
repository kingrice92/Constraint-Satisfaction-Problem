# CSCI6511_Project2
Repository for search algorithm created for project 2 of CSCI 6511.

In order to test the algorithm, navigate to the directory where the repository was downloaded and enter the following:

python cspSearch.py

I have included a test case in the file to generate a graph and run the graph coloring algorithm. The console should print a list of the nodes and their unique color assignments.
